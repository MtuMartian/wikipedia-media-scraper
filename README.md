# Simple web scraper to get all the svgs in a svg collection on commons.wikimedia.org

This was written specifically to get the cards in this collection https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_playing_cards_4 , but should be able to be used in any collection of SVGs or other media files on commons.wikimedia.org

Note that there is no error handling or logging so if one of the resources is not found, the script will stop execution at that point
